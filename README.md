## TITLE
US Gun Violence

## TEAM MEMBERS
- Kevin Flores
- Mayra Cruz
- Sodiq Alagbada
- Danielle Sears

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION & OUTLINE
We would like to illustrate a picture of gun violence in the US over the past 20 years. Based on this information, we can see what factors contribute to the increase in violence.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
- Do people with unregistered/registered guns commit more crime?

- Are there places where the opposite trends are true?

- What are the Incline/Decline rates of these crimes geographically over time?

- How does the victim's proximity to the shooter impact their survival likelihood?
- - Null Hypothesis 1: The proportion of victims within five years of the shooter’s age is the same as the proportion of the victim’s age.
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis A: Being within five years of age of the shooter makes it more likely to be victimized.
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis B: Being either 5+ years older or younger than the shooter increased the likelihood of becoming a victim.

- - Null: Having been familiar with the shooter before an incident does not impact whether or not one became a victim in a shooting incident
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis C: Circumstantial/Concrete evidence of a victim and shooter knowing each other increased the likelihood of becoming victimized.
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis D: No evidence to show a relationship between the victim and shooter corresponds with a higher likelihood of one becoming victimized.

## ROUGH BREAKDOWN OF TASKS
Each team member will work on cleaning data and creating visualizations to show our analysis of our seperate data questions/hypotheses. Danielle will be analyzing the relationship between victim and shooter proximity to each other. Mayra will be analzying gun violence trends over several decades. Sodiq will be assessing trends geographically throughout the US. Lastly, Kevin will be xxxx

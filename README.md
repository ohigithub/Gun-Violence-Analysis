# Gun Violence Analysis

## TITLE
US Gun Violence

## TEAM MEMBERS
- Kevin Flores
- Mayra Cruz
- Sodiq Alagbada
- Danielle Sears

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION & OUTLINE
We would like to illustrate a picture of gun violence in the US over the past 20 years. Based on this information, we can see what factors contribute to the increase in violence.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
- Do people with unregistered/registered guns commit more crime?

- Are there places where the opposite trends are true?

- What are the Incline/Decline rates of these crimes geographically over time?

- How does the victim's proximity to the shooter impact their survival likelihood?
- - Null Hypothesis 1: The proportion of victims within five years of the shooter’s age is the same as the proportion of the victim’s age.
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis A: Being within five years of age of the shooter makes it more likely to be victimized.
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis B: Being either 5+ years older or younger than the shooter increased the likelihood of becoming a victim.

- - Null Hypothesis 2: Having been familiar with the shooter before an incident does not impact whether or not one became a victim in a shooting incident
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis C: Circumstantial/Concrete evidence of a victim and shooter knowing each other increased the likelihood of becoming victimized.
- - Two-Tail Hypothesis D: No evidence to show a relationship between the victim and shooter corresponds with a higher likelihood of one becoming victimized.

## ROUGH BREAKDOWN OF TASKS
Each team member will work on cleaning data and creating visualizations to show our analysis of our seperate data questions/hypotheses. Danielle will be analyzing the relationship between victim and shooter proximity to each other and organize the slides. Mayra will be analzying gun violence trends over several decades. Sodiq will be assessing trends geographically throughout the US. Lastly, Kevin will be analyzing what the trends are for the time of day/week/year that shootings most often occur.

## CONCLUSIONS
Regarding question 1, we can reject the Null Hypothesis and accept the Two-Tail Hypothesis B as we can confirm being either 5+ years older or younger than the shooter increased the likelihood of becoming a victim.

For question 2, we can accept the null hypothesis. While unique cases demonstrate that some shooters mainly victimized people they were already familiar with and others did the exact opposite, the aggregate data showed that victims were not more or less likely to be familiar or not familiar with the shooter prior to the shooting.

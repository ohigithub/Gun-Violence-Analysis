US Gun Violence

## TEAM MEMBERS

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION & OUTLINE
We would like to illustrate a picture of gun violence in the US over the past 20 years. Based on this information, we can see what factors contribute to the increase in violence.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
- Do people with unregistered/registered guns commit more crime?
- Are there places where the opposite trends are true
- What are the Incline/Decline rates of these crimes geographically over time?

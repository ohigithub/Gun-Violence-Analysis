My question is:

Has it been an increase/decrease of mass shootings nationally (since 1966 to date)?
Has each state seen an increase/decrease of mass shootings in the same period of time?

The conclusion is that in effect, mass shootings are in an upward trend as time progresses. 
The amount of mass shootings incidents as well as fatalities are increasing exponentialy since 2010.
